*Below, Professors Michel DeGraff and Haynes Miller discuss the role of Platfòm MIT-Ayiti as an outgrowth of the activities of the MIT-Haiti Initiative.* 

During the workshops and symposia that MIT-Haiti carried out between 2010 and 2017, participants confirmed the importance of Kreyòl as an indispensable tool for active learning at all educational levels. As a result, the Initiative launched a digital platform, where all learners and teachers in Haiti can find and contribute high-quality materials in Kreyòl. These materials are meant as models for the creation of more materials by teachers in Haiti. 

Platfòm MIT-Ayiti is a large and open forum that gathers teachers, learners and education professionals who, together, are building a new kind of school that welcomes and honors all children. It is used to create, collect, evaluate, curate, review, organize, and share materials in Kreyòl for the classroom.  

The platform offers a variety of material: resources for use in the classroom, at all levels and in all subjects; examples for best teaching practices, such as sample lesson plans and teaching manuals; as well as interviews with artists, creolists and other activists fighting for high-quality education in Haiti.
