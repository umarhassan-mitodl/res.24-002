*Below, Professors Michel DeGraff and Haynes Miller discuss the development of the MIT-Haiti Initiative in the years since its founding.*

After a kickoff symposium at MIT in October 2010, we organized a series of seven intensive workshops in Haiti from 2012 to 2016, training some 250 teachers in modern pedagogical methods and supporting the development of Kreyòl as a language of instruction. Six of these teachers visited MIT in October 2015 to participate in specialized workshops on the production of active-learning materials in Kreyòl. Upon returning home, these teachers created the Konbit MIT-Ayiti offering similar active-learning workshops to their faculty colleagues in Haiti.  

Starting in 2017, we began writing a series of guides to educational practice, with focus on physics (published in 2019), biology, chemistry, and mathematics.  

Platfòm MIT-Ayiti was launched in 2019. Since then, we’ve been collecting, curating and sharing a wide range of free high-quality materials online in Kreyòl—in all disciplines and at all levels.
