  "course_description": "The mission of the MIT-Haiti Initiative is to promote active learning in Krey\u00f2l so that Haitians can have universal access to quality education in the language that most of them speak at home.\u00a0\n\n[Platf\u00f2m MIT-Ayiti](http://mit-ayiti.net/), launched in 2019,\u00a0offers a wealth of freely accessible educational resources in Krey\u00f2l, including downloadable lesson plans and picture books categorized by topic, alongside official curricula from Haiti's Ministry of National Education. The target audience for these resources includes students at all levels from pre-kindergarten through high school, and we offer materials in all disciplines. We also host and invite contributions from all educators who are willing to submit their own materials in Krey\u00f2l. We work with these contributions, in *konbit* (collaborative)\u00a0mode, to improve these submissions before publication. *Men anpil, chay pa lou!*\u00a0(That is, many hands make light work!)\n\nThe Initiative\u2019s original\u00a0[website](http://haiti.mit.edu/), launched in 2010,\u00a0includes software tools for math, physics, genetics, and biochemistry education, as well as a preliminary (work-in-progress) glossary of Krey\u00f2l equivalents for English words commonly used in the STEM disciplines.",
